Sure! Here's a simple algorithm to sort the list `[5, 2, 6, 1, 9]` in **ascending order** using the **Bubble Sort** method. Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement.

---

### âœ… **Algorithm: Bubble Sort**

**Step-by-step:**

1. Start with the list: `[5, 2, 6, 1, 9]`
2. Compare adjacent elements.
3. If the left element is greater than the right, swap them.
4. Repeat this process for each pair of adjacent elements, moving from the start to the end of the list.
5. After one full pass, the largest element will be at the end of the list.
6. Repeat the process for the remaining elements (excluding the last one, which is already sorted).
7. Continue until the entire list is sorted.

---

### ðŸ§  **Implementation in Python:**

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                # Swap the elements
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
numbers = [5, 2, 6, 1, 9]
sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)
```

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Output:**

```
[1, 2, 5, 6, 9]
```

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Alternative: Use Built-in Sort (Python)**

If you're just looking for a quick solution, you can use Python's built-in `sort()` method:

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 6, 1, 9]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 5, 6, 9]
```

---

Let me know if you'd like to see the algorithm implemented in another language or using a different sorting method (like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)!<|im_end|>

Based on the poker analysis, here's your situation:

**Your Hand Analysis:**
- **Hole cards:** Ace of Spades and King of Hearts (As Kh)
- **Community cards:** Jack of Diamonds, 10 of Clubs, 7 of Hearts (Jd 10c 7h)
- **Current best hand:** High card (Ace-high)
- **Win probability:** Approximately **40.8%** against random hands

**Strategic Recommendation:**
The system suggests a **check/call** action as your best play in this situation.

**Key Observations:**
1. You have **Ace-King suited** (As Kh), which is a strong starting hand
2. The flop (Jd 10c 7h) gives you Broadway straight possibilities with potential for Ace-high straights
3. You currently have no made hand (just Ace-high), but you have decent drawing chances
4. At 40.8% win probability against random ranges, you're in a moderately competitive position

This is a fairly standard spot where you're drawing to potentially the best hand but haven't connected strongly yet. Checking or making a small call would be appropriate depending on the betting action and your position.<|im_end|>
