I'm planning to organize a company event and I need to categorize the event website. Can you help me categorize the website with the domain name 'google.com'? Additionally, I need to verify the authenticity of a doctor. Can you fetch the verification details using the request ID '68bbb910-da9b-4d8a-9a1d-4bd878b19846'
Begin!

This is not the first time you try this task, all previous trails failed.
Before you generate my thought for this state, I will first show you your previous actions for this state, and then you must generate actions that is different from all of them. Here are some previous actions candidates:
[
  {
    "name": "webiste_categorization_v1_for_website_categorization",
    "arguments": "{\n  \"domainname\": \"google.com\"\n}",
    "function_output": "{\"error\": \"Rate limit error...\", \"response\": \"{'code': 403, 'messages': 'Access restricted. Check credits balance or enter the correct API key.'}\"}",
    "mento-carlo-action-value": 0.0
  }
]
again, your former observation: {"error": "", "response": "{'message': 'The requested id does not exist'}"}

Remember you are now in the intermediate state of a trail, you will first analyze the now state and previous action candidates, then make actions that is different from all the previous.<|im_end|>
