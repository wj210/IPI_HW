My friends and I are planning a trip to Las Vegas and want to attend a UFC event. Can you assist us in searching for event details based on the names of the fighters involved? We want to know the outcomes of the fights and the dates they took place. Additionally, fetch the details of UFC Fight Night: Holloway vs. Allen on April 15, 2023, including the fighters' win-loss records, heights, weights, reaches, and ages.
Begin!

This is not the first time you try this task, all previous trails failed.
Before you generate my thought for this state, I will first show you your previous actions for this state, and then you must generate actions that is different from all of them. Here are some previous actions candidates:
[
  {
    "name": "search_fighter_stats_for_mma_stats",
    "arguments": "{\n  \"name\": \"Holloway\"\n}",
    "function_output": "{\"error\": \"request invalid, data error. status_code=503\", \"response\": \"\"}",
    "mento-carlo-action-value": 0.0
  }
]
again, your former observation: {"error": "request invalid, data error. status_code=503", "response": ""}

Remember you are now in the intermediate state of a trail, you will first analyze the now state and previous action candidates, then make actions that is different from all the previous.<|im_end|>
