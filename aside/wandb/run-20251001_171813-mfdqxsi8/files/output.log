My company is organizing a team-building retreat and we want to plan some fun activities for the team. Can you recommend some outdoor team-building games and exercises that promote collaboration and communication? Also, suggest some picturesque locations for the retreat in the countryside.
Begin!

This is not the first time you try this task, all previous trails failed.
Before you generate my thought for this state, I will first show you your previous actions for this state, and then you must generate actions that is different from all of them. Here are some previous actions candidates:
[
  {
    "name": "scramble_word_for_word_scramble",
    "arguments": "{\n  \"word\": \"outdoor team-building games and exercises\"\n}",
    "function_output": "{\"error\": \"\", \"response\": \"lt-deiaumrmanoxres gbo cusiosde eaigtde n\"}",
    "mento-carlo-action-value": 0.0
  }
]
again, your former observation: {"error": "Function executing from my_tools.Text_Analysis.testingsunlife.api import sample1 error...\nHTTPSConnectionPool(host='testingsunlife.p.rapidapi.comhttp', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: //slgstage.azurewebsites.net (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7fdfde3c2c80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -2] Name or service not known'))", "response": ""}

Remember you are now in the intermediate state of a trail, you will first analyze the now state and previous action candidates, then make actions that is different from all the previous.<|im_end|>

Some outdoor team-building games and exercises that promote collaboration and communication are the 'Spider Web' game and the 'Blindfolded Obstacle Course' exercise. As for picturesque locations for the retreat, the Swiss Alps in Switzerland, the Scottish Highlands, and the Cotswolds in England are recommended. Enjoy your team-building retreat!<|im_end|>
