To determine the validity of the claim that **"people who eat breakfast perform better in school,"** you can design a **controlled experiment** that measures the relationship between breakfast consumption and academic performance. Here's a suggested experiment:

---

### **Experiment Title:**
**The Impact of Breakfast on Academic Performance in Students**

---

### **Objective:**
To determine whether eating breakfast is associated with improved academic performance in students.

---

### **Hypothesis:**
Students who eat breakfast will perform better in school (e.g., higher test scores, better grades, or improved attention and focus) compared to those who skip breakfast.

---

### **Participants:**
- A sample of students from the same school or grade level (e.g., middle school or high school).
- Ideally, a **randomized controlled trial** (RCT) where students are randomly assigned to either a **breakfast group** or a **no-breakfast group**.

---

### **Procedure:**

#### **1. Recruitment and Randomization:**
- Recruit a group of students (e.g., 100 students).
- Randomly assign them to two groups:
  - **Group A (Breakfast Group):** Students are given a healthy breakfast (e.g., cereal, toast, fruit, milk).
  - **Group B (No-Breakfast Group):** Students are instructed to skip breakfast for a set period (e.g., one week).

#### **2. Control Variables:**
- Ensure both groups are similar in terms of age, gender, academic background, and prior performance.
- Keep other factors constant (e.g., same school, same schedule, same tests).

#### **3. Data Collection:**
- **Pre-test:** Administer a standardized academic test (e.g., math or reading comprehension) to both groups before the experiment.
- **During the experiment:** Monitor and record whether students eat breakfast (Group A) or skip it (Group B).
- **Post-test:** Administer the same test again after the experimental period (e.g., one week later).

#### **4. Additional Measures (Optional):**
- Use surveys or questionnaires to assess students’ energy levels, concentration, and mood.
- Track attendance and participation in class.

---

### **Data Analysis:**
- Compare the **pre-test and post-test scores** of both groups.
- Use statistical methods (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to determine if there is a **significant difference** in academic performance between the two groups.
- Control for variables like prior academic performance, sleep, and extracurricular activities.

---

### **Ethical Considerations:**
- Ensure that students are not harmed or deprived of necessary nutrition.
- Obtain **informed consent** from parents or guardians.
- Provide a **nutritious alternative** for students who skip breakfast (e.g., a healthy snack) to avoid malnutrition.

---

### **Conclusion:**
- If the **breakfast group** shows significantly better academic performance, this supports the claim.
- If no significant difference is found, the claim may not be valid or may require further investigation.

---

### **Limitations:**
- The experiment may not account for individual differences in metabolism, learning styles, or home environment.
- Long-term effects of breakfast on academic performance may not be captured in a short-term study.

---

### **Alternative Approach (Observational Study):**
If a randomized trial is not feasible, you could conduct an **observational study** by:
- Surveying students about their breakfast habits.
- Collecting academic records (e.g., grades, test scores).
- Using statistical analysis to look for a correlation between breakfast consumption and academic performance.

---

This experiment provides a structured way to test the claim and determine whether eating breakfast has a measurable impact on school performance.<|im_end|>

To make the sentence more descriptive, we can rearrange the adjectives to follow the typical order: **opinion, size, age, color**.

Original sentence:
**The family had a small brown old house.**

Rearranged adjectives:
**old**, **small**, **brown**

So the more descriptive phrase becomes:
**The family had an old small brown house.**

Alternatively, for a more natural and poetic flow, you might say:
**The family had an old, small, brown house.**<|im_end|>

Weekend getaway snapshot – Springfield, Missouri

- Current weather right now (as of 12:15 p.m. Central):
  – Temperature: 90 °F; feels like 100 °F
  – Humidity: 49 %
  – Wind: 12–13 mph from the south

- 3-day forecast (Aug 8–10):
  – **Friday 8/8:** Sunny, 96 °F / 72 °F, winds up to 14 mph, humidity ~69 %, no rain expected.
  – **Saturday 8/9:** Mostly sunny and hot, 97 °F / 75 °F, breezier with gusts up to 19 mph, humidity ~65 %.
  – **Sunday 8/10:** Continued sunshine, 95 °F / 74 °F, similar breeze, humidity ~66 %.

Packing suggestions
Expect very warm, mostly clear conditions: bring lightweight, breathable clothing, a wide-brim hat, sunscreen, and comfortable sandals or shoes. Evenings stay warm (low 70s), so a light hoodie or long-sleeve shirt should suffice if you’ll be out after dark. A reusable water bottle will come in handy, and sunglasses are a must given the strong August sun.<|im_end|>

Below are some Springfield, Missouri favorites that pair well with the warm, mostly sunny, low-humidity weekend the weather data is predicting. Because you’ll be outside most of the time and highs will be in the mid-90 °Fs (32–36 °C), the list is weighted toward spots where you can duck into shade or A/C trade-offs.

1. Nathanael Greene / Close Memorial Park (and nearby gardens)
   • 160-acre green-space with botanical gardens, a lake loop trail, and plenty of shade.
   • Morning visit = cooler temps; they open at 6 a.m.
   • Free admission; the Mizumoto Japanese Stroll Garden has a modest entrance fee if you want extra shade and running water features.

2. Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield
   • Great for a self-guided driving tour (all windows-down, warm-breeze type of fun).
   • Visitor center (air-conditioned) opens 8 a.m.–5 p.m., plus you can hop out for 15-minute trail segments to see cannon emplacements and the iconic “Bloody Hill” overlook.

3. Fantastic Caverns
   • 58 °F year-round—perfect natural air-conditioning for 45–60 minutes.
   • Tours depart every 20–30 minutes; book early because they fill up fast on summer weekends.

4. Rutledge-Wilson Farm Community Park
   • Open dawn–dusk trails, sunflower fields in bloom, goat barns with misting fans.
   • Free unless you spring for funnel cake or fresh peaches at their produce stand.

5. Lake Springfield Park and South Creek Greenway Trail
   • Rent a kayak or paddleboard 9 a.m.–4 p.m. (Saturday & Sunday). The water temp is pleasant (mid-80 °Fs) and the tree-lined coves block a lot of wind.
   • 8-mile paved greenway connects to Sequiota Park if you want to bike the whole corridor—bring extra water, and start before 10 a.m.

6. Downtown mural & coffee hop
   • Start at Kingdom Coffee downtown, 8 a.m.; they have high-ABV cold brew on nitro for a mid-morning pick-me-up.
   • Then wander Commercial and Patton streets on foot—most murals are on the shaded, north-facing walls during the heat of the day.

7. Wonders of Wildlife National Museum & Aquarium
   • Technically indoors—classic A/C plus immersive wildlife dioramas and a massive freshwater-to-ocean aquarium tunnel.
   • Reserve backed-up weekend slots online; give yourself 3–4 hours.

Evening-only add-ons
• Ozark Empire Fairgrounds Swap Meet (Sat 6 a.m.–4 p.m. if you’re an early-bird treasure hunter).
• Springfield Cardinals baseball (Hammons Field, 6:30 p.m. first pitch Saturday) — lawn seats pair nicely with sunset and a cool breeze once the sun dips.
• Bass Pro Outdoor World’s 6-story indoor waterfall and archery showroom doubles as an evening “walk-through attraction” – air-conditioned, free, and always open.

Pack recap reminder (travel light, beat the heat): refillable bottle, wide-brim or cap, SPF 50 reapplied every 2 hrs, quick-dry shirt, and one light layer in case the caverns or the 6 p.m. stadium breeze gets chillier than you expect.<|im_end|>
