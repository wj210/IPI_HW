# Tools

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{"name": "get_policy_for_mypolicyapi", "description": "This is the subfunction for tool \"mypolicyapi\", you can use this tool.The description of this function is: \"get_policy_for_mypolicyapi\"", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}, "required": [], "optional": []}}
{"name": "syntax_status_syntax_ticket_get_for_ifc_bim_services", "description": "This is the subfunction for tool \"ifc_bim_services\", you can use this tool.The description of this function is: \"Check Result of a syntax check\"", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"ticket": {"type": "string", "description": ""}}, "required": ["ticket"], "optional": []}}

This is not the first time you try this task, all previous trails failed.
Before you generate my thought for this state, I will first show you your previous actions for this state, and then you must generate actions that is different from all of them. Here are some previous actions candidates:
[
  {
    "name": "get_policy_for_mypolicyapi",
    "arguments": "{}",
    "function_output": "{\"error\": \"\", \"response\": \"{'message': 'Invalid API key. Go to https://docs.rapidapi.com/docs/keys for more info.'}\"}",
    "mento-carlo-action-value": 0.0
  }
]
again, your former observation: {"error": "", "response": "{'message': 'Invalid API key. Go to https://docs.rapidapi.com/docs/keys for more info.'}"}

Remember you are now in the intermediate state of a trail, you will first analyze the now state and previous action candidates, then make actions that is different from all the previous.<|im_end|>
